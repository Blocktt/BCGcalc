<p>Apply taxa translation before running other calculations to get the
proper Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU).</p>

<div id="official-taxa-files" class="section level1">
<h1>Official Taxa Files</h1>
<p>URL for Official taxa files and metadata files is provided below.</p>
<p>Both files are included in the output of the taxa translator
function.</p>

<h1>File Inputs</h1>
<p>Any file can be run through the file builder but it is suggested the
file be ready for use in <code>BioMonTools</code> or
<code>BCGcalc</code> functions. That is, it has the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SampleID</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique sample identifier. Includes any replicate/duplicate
information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>TaxaID</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique taxa name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>N_Taxa</p>
<ul>
<li>Count of taxa individuals</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other Optional Columns</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, station, date, latitude, longitude, elevation,
gradient, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The user will be required to identify the basic fields in their file
in the select boxes. The user also has the ability to include additional
fields in their output (e.g., collection date, latitude, longitude,
station). These additional fields need to be unique to the sample and
not the taxa (e.g., do not include notes from the taxonomist as this
could cause issues if two or more taxa and combined in to a coarser taxa
name).</p>
<p>The select boxes will contain the columns names of the user file that
was already uploaded.</p>
