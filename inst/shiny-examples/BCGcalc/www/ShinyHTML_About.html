<p>The BCGcalc Shiny app is a free R-based tool to help calculate
Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) metric and site/sample scores.</p>
<p>This Shiny app is linked to the BCGcalc and BioMonTools R packages,
which were developed by Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech and are available
on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc</a>).</p>
<p>Development of the BCGcalc and BioMonTools R packages have been
funded, in part, by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a</p>
<p><strong>NEEDS work </strong></p>
<p>larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for
freshwater streams and inland lakes (USEPA 2016, USEPA 2021; lead EPA
scientist: Britta Bierwagen). The RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative
effort in which entities collect long-term data at targeted sites to
detect changes over time.</p>
<p>If you encounter problems with the Shiny app and/or have suggestions
on ways to further improve it, please email Erik (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) or post your comments on the
ContDataSumViz GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc/discussions" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc/discussions</a>). This is
an open-source, collaborative effort and we welcome your feedback.</p>
