MTTI background

The Macroinvertebrate Thermal Tolerance Index (MTTI) for freshwater wadeable streams in Oregon and Washington is still a work in progress. Once it is completed, we will add it to this website when resources permit.

The MTTI generates Maximum Weekly Maximum Temperature (MWMT) values for each macroinvertebrate sample based on the relative abundances and MWMT weighted average optima values of the taxa in the sample. MWMT is the metric that Oregon and Washington use for their numeric water temperature standard to protect salmonid habitat and is available from the 
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml" target="_blank">NorWeST modeled stream temperature database</a>.
The MTTI utilizes the weighted average optima values that are being published in Stamp et al. (in progress). The MTTI builds on earlier work by ODEQ (Huff et al. 2006) in which they developed a thermal tolerance index, but with many fewer samples (328 sites vs. 3685 sites). The MTTI value can be interpreted as a ‘realized thermal niche, for an assemblage’, and can help detect deviation from natural thermal regimes. It may also provide important insights on resiliency. For example, if cold stenotherm taxa are persisting at a site with a NorWeST MWMT value greater than 16°C, investigating what factors make that site suitable for those taxa could inform tactics for restoring or protecting cold water refugia in other streams. Factors likely include habitat quality and complexity, groundwater, refugia, food quality and availability, and level of watershed disturbance.
