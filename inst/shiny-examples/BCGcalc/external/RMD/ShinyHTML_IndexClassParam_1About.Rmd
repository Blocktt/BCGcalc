# Purpose
The BCG calculator requires the inclusion of Index Name and Index Class fields 
in the input file (otherwise the R code won’t know which BCG rules to apply). 
These are not fields that users normally have in their data files, so we added 
this function to make that step easier.  Even fewer users have access to the
tools needed to generate the input variables (elevation and slope) for each of
their sites.

## Index_Name
At this time, there is only one Index_Name option for the MaritimeNW model:
BCG_MariNW_Bugs500ct. This is set as the default. In the future, multiple 
options may be introduced.

## Index_Class
The MaritimeNW model has three classes based on elevation and gradient/slope:

*	low gradient/lower elevation (LoGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/lower elevation (HiGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/higher elevation (HiGrad-HiElev)

The classification thresholds are 1% for gradient and 750-m for elevation.

During BCG model development, we derived gradient and elevation information from
the following sources:

•	Gradient - NHDPlusV2 flowline slope (x 100) from the 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data" target = "_blank">NHDPlusV2</a> 
Attributes table (McKay et a. 2016)

•	Elevation - EPA 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset" target = "_blank">EPA StreamCat</a>
elevation, local catchment scale (Hill et al. 2016)

# Required Fields

*	SampleID or SiteID– unique identifier

    +	Tip: pick an identifier that can be linked to other files (such as the file 
coming out of the File Builder – Taxa Translator/Attribute function)

* Latitude

    + Decimal degrees
    
* Longitude

    + Decimal degrees
    
* EPSG

    + Datum for coordinates.  If not provided then the value 4269 (NAD83, North
    America) will be used for the calculation. 
    <a href = "https://epsg.io/4269" target = "_blank">https://epsg.io/4269</a>

If you named the required fields differently in your input file, it’s ok. Click
on the drop-down menus. The list of fields in your input file will appear. 
Select the correct column headings.
