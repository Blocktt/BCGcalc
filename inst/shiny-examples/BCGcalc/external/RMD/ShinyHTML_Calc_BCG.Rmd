The PNMR BCG model assigns samples to six levels of biological condition along a generalized stressor-response curve, ranging from observable biological 
conditions found at no or low levels of stressors (level 1) to those found at 
high levels of stressors (level 6) (Figure 2). The PNMR model was calibrated for macroinvertebrate communities in three classes of freshwater wadeable streams: 
low gradient (<1%)/lower elevation (<750 m); higher gradient (≥1%)/lower 
elevation (<750 m); and higher gradient (≥1%)/higher elevation (≥750 m). 

The model is intended to be applied to samples that meet the following criteria:

*	Freshwater wadeable streams

*	Within the following Omernik Level 3 ecoregions: Coast Range, Puget Lowland, Willamette Valley, Cascades, and North Cascades, excluding xeric regions (< 650 
mm mean annual precipitation) (Figure 1)

*	Total watershed area: 5 to 260 km2 (2 to 100 mi2)

*	Target number of organisms: 500. The number of individuals should not exceed 
600; if it does, random subsampling should be applied

*	Sampling effort: at least 8 ft2 sampling area 

*	Lowest practical taxonomic resolution based on current Standard Taxonomic
Effort guidelines (Wisseman et al. 2015)

*	Collection gear: D-Frame kick-nets or Surber net with 500-micrometer mesh net

*	Collection method: targeted-riffle or reachwide, multihabitat (Hayslip 2007)

*	Collection period: summer baseflow period (typically June through mid-October) 

Model calibration is described in detail in [Stamp 2022](links/PNMR_BCG_report_20220930_minusSupp.zip).
