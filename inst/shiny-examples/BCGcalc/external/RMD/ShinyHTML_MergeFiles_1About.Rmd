# Purpose
Merge two files (sites and samples) for use with metric/index/model 
calculations.

* File 1, Samples with benthic data

* File 2, Sites with Index Class

Merging will retain all rows of file 2 (samples) and add all columns of file 1
(sites) where the files match.  The user will select a column from each file to
perform the merge.  Column names that overlap will be have the suffix '.x' or 
'.y' for files 1 and 2, respectively.

The user will have the option of viewing both input files and the merged file
before download.
