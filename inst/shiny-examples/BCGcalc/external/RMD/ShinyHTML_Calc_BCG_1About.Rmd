The PNMR BCG model was calibrated for macroinvertebrate communities in three classes of freshwater wadeable streams: 

*	low gradient/lower elevation (LoGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/lower elevation (HiGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/higher elevation (HiGrad-HiElev)

The classification thresholds are 1% for gradient and 750-m for elevation.

During calibration of the BCG model, we derived gradient from the

Attributes table (flowline slope*100) and elevation from the 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset" target="_blank">EPA StreamCat</a> 
 dataset (local catchment scale).
 
The PNMR BCG model is intended to be applied to samples that meet the following criteria:

*	Freshwater wadeable streams

*	Within the following Omernik Level 3 ecoregions: Coast Range, Puget Lowland, Willamette 
Valley, Cascades, and North Cascades, excluding xeric regions (< 650 mm mean annual precipitation) (Figure 1)

*	Total watershed area: 5 to 260 km2 (2 to 100 mi2)

*	Target number of organisms: 500. The number of individuals should not exceed 600; if it does, random subsampling should be applied

*	Sampling effort: at least 8 ft2 sampling area 

*	Lowest practical taxonomic resolution based on current PNMR 
<a href="https://www.pnamp.org/project/northwest-standard-taxonomic-effort" target="_blank">Standard Taxonomic Effort guidelines</a>

*	Collection gear: D-Frame kick-nets or Surber net with 500-micrometer mesh net

*	Collection method: targeted-riffle or reachwide, multihabitat (
<a href="https://www.pnamp.org/document/1359" target="_blank">Hayslip 2007</a>
)

*	Collection period: summer baseflow period (typically June through mid-October)
