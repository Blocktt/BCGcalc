# Purpose
Apply taxa translation before running other calculations to get the proper
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU).

# Official Taxa Files
URL for Official taxa files and metadata files is provided below.

Both files are included in the output of the taxa translator function.

Taxa Translate Official Files on 
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official" target = "_blank">GitHub</a>.

# File Inputs
Any file can be run through the file builder but it is suggested the file be 
ready for use in `BioMonTools` or `BCGcalc` functions.  That is, it has the 
columns:

* SampleID

    + Unique sample identifier.  Includes any replicate/duplicate information.

* TaxaID

    + Unique taxa name

* N_Taxa

    + Count of taxa individuals
    
* Other Optional Columns

    + For example, station, date, latitude, longitude, elevation, gradient, etc.
    
The user will be required to identify the basic fields in their file in the
select boxes.  The user also has the ability to include additional fields in 
their output (e.g., collection date, latitude, longitude, station).  These
additional fields need to be unique to the sample and not the taxa (e.g., do 
not include notes from the taxonomist as this could cause issues if two or 
more taxa and combined in to a coarser taxa name).

The select boxes will contain the columns names of the user file that was 
already uploaded.
