```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE
                      , results = 'asis'
                      , warning = FALSE
                      , message = FALSE)
```

A single zip file will be available for download.  It will include all result
files along the the original data file.  All result data files will be CSV 
format.

The zip file will included the base name of the original file along with the 
date and time.

The individual files will include the same basename along with a suffix to 
represent each step of the calculation process.

As an example if the input file was "Data_BCG_PacNW.csv" the result files will
look like those in the table below.

```{r}
fn_base <- "Data_BCG_PacNW"
suffix <- c(paste0("_taxatrans_"
            , c("0fileversions"
                , "1official"
                , "1attributes"
                , "1metadata"
                , "2taxatrans"
                , "3nonmatch"
                , "MERGED")))
file_names <- c(paste0(fn_base, ".csv")
       , paste0(fn_base, suffix, ".csv"))
file_desc <- c("User input data"
               , "File name versions"
               , "Official taxa list"
               , "Official taxa attributes (only if separate from official list)"
               , "Metadata for Official taxa list"
               , "Crosswalk taxa table (translations), input to official"
               , "Non-matching taxa"
               , "Merged data results") 
df_zip <- data.frame(cbind(file_names, file_desc))
names(df_zip) <- c("File Names", "File Descriptions")
cap_zip <- "Taxa Translator zip file contents."
knitr::kable(df_zip, caption = cap_zip)
```
