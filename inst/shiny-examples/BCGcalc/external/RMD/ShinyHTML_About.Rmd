The BCGcalc Shiny app is a free R-based tool that calculates outputs for 
Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) models (
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="_blank">US EPA 2016</a>
). It is linked to the 
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BCGcalc" target="_blank">BCGcalc</a> 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a> 
R packages, which were developed by Erik W. Leppo (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) from Tetra Tech and are available on GitHub. 

This website is customized to calculate the BCG model for macroinvertebrate 
assemblages in freshwater wadeable streams in the Pacific Northwest Maritime 
Region (PNMR) of Oregon and Washington (Figure 1). It also calculates thermal preference metrics and probability of membership in cold, cool or warm-water communities, which can help inform restoration and protection efforts and 
climate resiliency. The user uploads input files to the website, which will 
generate the outputs without the use of R code. Those who prefer to work with R 
can download the R packages from the GitHub sites.  

The PNMR BCG model assigns samples to six levels of biological condition along a generalized stressor-response curve, ranging from observable biological 
conditions found at no or low levels of stressors (level 1) to those found at 
high levels of stressors (level 6) (Figure 2). The PNMR model was calibrated for macroinvertebrate communities in three classes of freshwater wadeable streams: 
low gradient (<1%)/lower elevation (<750 m); higher gradient (≥1%)/lower 
elevation (<750 m); and higher gradient (≥1%)/higher elevation (≥750 m). 

The model is intended to be applied to samples that meet the following criteria:

*	Freshwater wadeable streams

*	Within the following Omernik Level 3 ecoregions: Coast Range, Puget Lowland, Willamette Valley, Cascades, and North Cascades, excluding xeric regions (< 650 
mm mean annual precipitation) (Figure 1)

*	Total watershed area: 5 to 260 km2 (2 to 100 mi2)

*	Target number of organisms: 500. The number of individuals should not exceed 
600; if it does, random subsampling should be applied

*	Sampling effort: at least 8 ft2 sampling area 

*	Lowest practical taxonomic resolution based on current Standard Taxonomic
Effort guidelines (Wisseman et al. 2015)

*	Collection gear: D-Frame kick-nets or Surber net with 500-micrometer mesh net

*	Collection method: targeted-riffle or reachwide, multihabitat (Hayslip 2007)

*	Collection period: summer baseflow period (typically June through mid-October) 

Model calibration is described in detail in [Stamp 2022](links/PNMR_BCG_report_20220930_minusSupp.zip).
