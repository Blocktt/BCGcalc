The BCGcalc Shiny app is a free R-based tool to help calculate Biological
Condition Gradient (BCG) metric and site/sample scores. 

This Shiny app is linked to the

<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a>
R packages, which were developed by Erik W. Leppo (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) 
from Tetra Tech and are available on GitHub.

Development of the BCGcalc and BioMonTools R packages have been funded, in part,
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research 
and Development (ORD) as part of a .....

Only tab- or comma-separated files are allowed as input.

The input is for metric calculation using BioMonTools.

Metric values will be calculated and then used for the BCG model.
Metric membership, level membership, and level assignment will be done in a 
single process. 

Data outputs from all steps will be available in the final output download.


New models can be added to Rules.xlsx on BCGcalc GitHub repo and will be 
reflected in the selection box in the Shiny App.

are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect
long-term data at targeted sites to detect changes over time.
