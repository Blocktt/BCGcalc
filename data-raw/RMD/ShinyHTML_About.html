and
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" target="_blank">BioMonTools</a>
R packages, which were developed by Erik W. Leppo (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) from Tetra Tech and are
available on GitHub.</p>
<p>Development of the BCGcalc and BioMonTools R packages have been
funded, in part, by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a â€¦..</p>
<p><strong>NEEDS work </strong></p>
<p>larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for
freshwater streams and inland lakes (USEPA 2016, USEPA 2021; lead EPA

effort in which entities collect long-term data at targeted sites to
detect changes over time.</p>
