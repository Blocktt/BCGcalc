# Future Possibile Features (Wish List)

  - ~~Add excluded taxa flag to samples based on levels of taxonomy.
    Will not be completely accurate. Will have many false positives and
    false negatives. That is, if there are only organisms at the higher
    level in a sample it will fail. And if there are no organisms of the
    target group it will pass.~~
    
      - ~~Pass, Fail on each. And overall flag~~
      - ~~Chiro (tribe and family)~~
      - ~~Oligo~~
      - ~~Trombidiformes~~

  - Hi/Lo models.
    
      - ~~parameter to run “correct” model or all models for each
        site.~~
      - Have a field for site type. So can override gradient.

  - ~~Report - QC, use DataExplorer.~~

  - ~~Table of metrics for each model with DataExplorer report.~~

  - Include a master taxa list.
    
      - Match data input and add information (phylo and auteco)
      - Ability to report back unmatched

  - Generate SiteType from data (gradient for PacNW)

  - Update For loop in BCG.Level.Assignment to apply function (similar
    to BCG.Level.Membership).

  - Any issues as reported on GitHub.

    dominant 2 metrics are the 4 that have issues.
